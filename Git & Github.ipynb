    "# Git & GitHub: Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "**Git** is a Version Control System (VCS) that helps track changes in code, manage project history, and enable collaboration. GitHub, a popular platform for hosting Git repositories, allows developers to store and manage their code online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is:\n",
    "- **Popular**: Widely used by developers worldwide.\n",
    "- **Free & Open Source**: Available for anyone to use and modify.\n",
    "- **Fast & Scalable**: Efficient even for large projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of Git:\n",
    "1. **Tracking History**: Records changes, making it easy to view and revert to previous versions.\n",
    "2. **Collaboration**: Allows multiple contributors to work on the same project seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Git Configuration\n",
    "Configuring Git tells it which account or username to use for tracking changes in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"your_email@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning a Repository\n",
    "**Cloning** a repository means creating a local copy of a project stored on a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone <repository_link>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Status\n",
    "**Status** shows the current state of files in the working directory and staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Untracked**: New files not yet tracked by Git.\n",
    "- **Modified**: Files that have been changed but not staged.\n",
    "- **Staged**: Files ready to be committed.\n",
    "- **Unmodified**: Files with no changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Staging and Committing Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Changes\n",
    "**Add** new or modified files to the staging area in preparation for committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add <file_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Committing Changes\n",
    "A **commit** records changes in the repository’s history, with a descriptive message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Commit message describing the changes\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initializing a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Setup\n",
    "Use **init** to create a new Git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git init\n",
    "git remote add origin <repository_link>\n",
    "git remote -v            # Verify remote repository\n",
    "git branch                # Check current branch\n",
    "git branch -M main        # Rename default branch to 'main'\n",
    "git push -u origin main   # Push to the remote repository with -u for future pushes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Branch?\n",
    "A **branch** in Git represents an independent line of development. Each branch is essentially a pointer to a specific commit. Branches enable you to make changes without affecting the main version of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Branches?\n",
    "Branches are beneficial for:\n",
    "1. **Isolating Work**: Work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.\n",
    "2. **Collaboration**: Allows multiple team members to work independently and merge their contributions later.\n",
    "3. **Version Control**: Maintain different versions of a project, like stable (`main`) vs. development versions.\n",
    "4. **Experimentation**: Create branches for testing new ideas, which can be merged or discarded later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Branch Commands\n",
    "- **Create a branch**: `git branch <branch_name>`\n",
    "- **Switch to a branch**: `git checkout <branch_name>`\n",
    "- **Create and switch to a new branch**: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`\n",
    "- **Rename a branch**: `git branch -M main`\n",
    "- **Delete a branch**: `git branch -d <branch_name>`\n",
    "- **Merge a branch into the current branch**: `git merge <branch_name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "Imagine you want to add a dark mode feature to your application. You can:\n",
    "1. **Create a branch** for the feature:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout -b dark-mode-feature\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Develop and commit** changes on `dark-mode-feature`.\n",
    "3. **Switch back to `main`** and merge the feature when ready:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout main\n",
    "   git merge dark-mode-feature\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **Delete the feature branch** after merging if it's no longer needed:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git branch -d dark-mode-feature\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Merging and Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging Branches\n",
    "Combines changes from one branch into another, typically for integrating a feature branch back into `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge <branch_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Pull Request (PR)\n",
    "A **Pull Request** is used on platforms like GitHub to propose and review changes before merging. It lets team members review code changes before they are merged into the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syncing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling Changes\n",
    "**Pull** updates the local repository to match the latest changes from the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pushing Changes\n",
    "**Push** uploads local changes to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Viewing Differences\n",
    "To see changes between files, branches, or commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git diff\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking Git Log\n",
    "To view a history of commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Merge Conflicts\n",
    "Merge conflicts occur when Git can’t automatically resolve differences between two commits. They require manual intervention to reconcile the differences and complete the merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Undoing Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resetting Staged Changes\n",
    "Unstage files that have been added to the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset <file_name>\n",
    "git reset                 # Unstages all files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Undoing Commits\n",
    "1. **Undo the most recent commit**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git reset HEAD~1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Undo multiple commits**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git reset <commit_hash>\n",
    "   git reset --hard <commit_hash>   # Completely remove history up to a specific commit\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forking a Repository\n",
    "A **Fork** is a rough copy of a repository, allowing you to make independent changes without affecting the original project. Forks are useful for contributing to public projects, where you can propose changes from your forked copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "**GitHub** is an online platform for managing Git repositories, enabling collaboration, issue tracking, and code review. It simplifies managing, sharing, and contributing to projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
